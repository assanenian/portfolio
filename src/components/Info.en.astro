      Trained as a geographer, I have extensive experience in the design, 
      collection, processing, and analysis of survey and census data. 
      When census data are outdated, I apply advanced modeling technique-
      such as <b>machine learning</b> and <b>geostatistics</b>- in combination with
      remote sensing data to generate high-resolution population estimates.
      Holding a <b>PhD in health geography</b>, I specialise in applying spatial
      epidemiological tools and methods to analyze health determinants and 
      contextual risk factors associated with infectious diseases. I am working 
      the following sotwares:
