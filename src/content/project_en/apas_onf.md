Lead developer for the complete redevelopment of the CSE (Employee Representative Committee) management tool for apas-onf from **scratch** to **production**.

After conducting a needs assessment, we developed a tailored solution for the _Office National des Forêts (ONF)_.

Thanks to the close collaboration of our team, the _NOUS_ agency, and the _ONF_, we were able to deliver a software solution that is both _comprehensive_ and _scalable_ within the established timelines.

We also carried out the migration of the legacy data from _prowebce_ to our database and _Elasticsearch_.
