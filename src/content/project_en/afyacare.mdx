**Key Features:**

1. **Rechargeable Health Wallet:** Users can recharge their electronic health wallet at authorized pharmacies by depositing cash or making electronic payments. This feature ensures that funds are available for future medical expenses.

2. **Expense Management:** Users can track their medical expenses, including medications, etc. The application generates reports for a comprehensive overview of healthcare expenses.

3. **Pharmacy Locator:** Provides a list of authorized pharmacies and healthcare providers nearby, including pharmacies on duty.

4. **Medical History:** Allows users to maintain a history of their medical visits, prescribed medications, etc.

5. **Data Security:** Ensures the confidentiality and security of users' medical and financial data in compliance with the strictest security standards.

6. **Fundraising:** Users can create a fundraising campaign by specifying the beneficiary's name, the reason for fundraising (e.g., medical expenses for surgery), and the target amount.

Once the campaign reaches its goal or a portion of it, the funds are transferred directly to the beneficiary to cover medical expenses.
